**Note: While this implementation is used by us and has not caused major problems, we do not recommend it yet production environments.**
 Please use the [leveldb](https://github.com/skade/leveldb) or [rocksdb](https://github.com/rust-rocksdb/rust-rocksdb) crate for this purpose.

This implementation does *not* aim to reimplement LevelDB. The major differences are:
* *Separation of keys and values*: Values can be stored seperately to increase compaction speed as outlined in the [WiscKey](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/fast16/fast16-papers-lu.pdf) paper
* *Concurrent compaction*: Multiple threads can compact at the same time for higher write throughput
* *Async-support*: All API calls are exposed as async functions
* *io_uring-support*: For async file system access on Linux. Optional and still considered experimental.
* *Bloom filters* for faster lookups

## Supported Platforms and Architectures
Currently, the code is only tested with Linux on x86 machines, but it should run on most systems supported by the Rust compiler.

## On-Disk Format
LSM stores data using [zerocopy](https://github.com/google/zerocopy) to achieve high performance.
The implementation does not account for endianness so on-disk formats are not portable.
Replication across machines should be handled at a different layer of the system.
However, we may add a converter tool in the future or an `endianess` feature flag if needed.

## Planned Features
* FLSM: Like [PebblesDB](https://github.com/utsaslab/pebblesdb) LSM-rs will fragment the keyspace to reduce write amplification and increase compaction speed
* Custom sorting functions
* More modularity and configuration options

## Feature Flags
* `snappy-compression`: Use the [snappy format](https://docs.rs/snap/1.0.5/snap/) to compress data on disk *(enabled by default)*
* `bloom-filters`: Add bloom filters to data blocks for more efficient searching. *(enabled by default)*
* `async-io`: Use `tokio_uring` for I/O instead of that of the standard library. Note, that this only works recent version of the Linux kernel. *(disabled by default)*
* `wisckey`: Store keys and values separately. This usually results in higher throughput with slightly higher CPU-usage. *(disabled by default)*

## Synchronous API
This crate exposes an async API intended to be used with Tokio or a similar runtime.
Alternatively, you can use the lsm-sync crate included in this repo, which internally uses Tokio but expose a synchronous API.

## Sort Order
You need to serialize your data in a way that its byte representation maintains the same ordering as the unserialized data.
For example, you may want to use [big endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) encoding so that numerical values are ordered correctly.

## Usage

You can create or open a new databse instance as shown below.
```rust
use lsm::{Database, Params};

// Set options here, such as the location of the database files
let params = Params {
    db_path,
    ..Default::default()
};

// Instantiate database
let database = Database::new_with_params(SM, params)
    .await
    .expect("Failed to create database instance");
```

To write to the database use the `get` call. Note that the crate only supports
writing byte vectors. (De-)serialization is supposed to happen at another layer.
```rust
let key = String::from("mykey").into_bytes();
let value = String::from("hello world").into_bytes();

database.put(key, value).await.expect("Writing to database failed");
```

When reading, LSM will return a reference to the data to avoid copying.
```rust
let value_ref = database.get(&key).await.expect("Reading failed");

// Returns a slice to the data
let data: &[u8] = value_ref.get_value();

// Assuming the put from above workd, this will print "hello world"
println!("{}", std::str::from_utf(data).unwrap());
```

Please refer to the tests for more examples to how to use the crate.

## Tests
This library ships with several tests. We provide a [justfile](https://github.com/casey/just) for convenience:

```sh
just test #runs all tests for all configurations
just lint #runs cargo clippy
```

## Notes on io-uring
Currently, the io-uring feature relies on [tokio-uring-executor](https://github.com/kaimast/tokio-uring-executor), a simplistic multi-threaded wrapper around `tokio-uring`.
Eventually `tokio-uring` will [support multiple threads natively](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio-uring/issues/258) and this workaround will be removed.

I would also like to add support for more mature io_uring runtimes such as [gloomio](https://github.com/DataDog/glommio) but only have limited time to work on this crate. Help is very welcome.
